[05:01.08] Innocence caressing me
[05:06.01] I never felt so young before
[05:11.17] There was so much life in me
[05:16.10] Still I longed to search for more
[05:29.25] But those days are gone now
[05:33.24] Changed like a leaf on a tree
[05:36.35] Blown away forever
[05:40.37] Into the cool autumn breeze
[05:44.37] The snow has now fallen
[05:48.44] And my sun's not so bright
[05:51.47] I struggle to hold on
[05:55.57] With the last of my might
