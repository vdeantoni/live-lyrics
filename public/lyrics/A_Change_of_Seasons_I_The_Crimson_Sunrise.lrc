[04:27.77] I remember a time
[04:30.75] My frail, virgin mind
[04:34.79] Watched the crimson sunrise
[04:39.88] Imagined what it might find
[04:43.83] Life was filled with wonder
[04:47.96] I felt the warm wind blow
[04:51.91] I must explore the boundaries
[04:57.07] Transcend the depth of winter's snow
