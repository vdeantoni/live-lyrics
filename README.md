## 🏗 Architecture

### Client-Server Communication
1. **Server** polls macOS Music app via AppleScript every request
2. **Client** queries server every 300ms using React Query
3. **External APIs** provide lyrics and album artwork
4. **React Query** handles caching and persistence across sessions

### Key Components
- **LyricsVisualizer**: Main container orchestrating layout
- **LyricsProvider**: Data fetching and state management
- **LyricsDisplay**: Visual effects and background rendering
- **LyricsContent**: Synchronized lyrics rendering
- **Player**: Music controls with animated song information
- **SettingsScreen**: Comprehensive settings panel with drag-and-drop provider management
- **Settings Components**: Modular components for player, lyrics, and artwork provider configuration

## 🔧 Development

### Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm dev` | Start development servers (client + server) |
| `pnpm build` | Build for production |
| `pnpm test` | Run all tests |
| `pnpm lint` | Fix linting issues |
| `pnpm format` | Format code with Prettier |

### Workspace Commands

| Workspace | Command | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Client | `cd client && pnpm dev` | Vite dev server (port 5173) |
| Server | `cd server && pnpm dev` | Node.js server (port 4000) |

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses Husky to run quality checks before each commit:
- **Format check**: Ensures code is properly formatted (`pnpm format:check`)
- **Lint check**: Ensures no linting errors (`pnpm lint:check`)
- **Test**: Ensures all tests pass (`pnpm test`)

These checks leverage Turborepo's caching system for faster execution.

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests and quality checks (`pnpm test && pnpm lint:check && pnpm format:check`)
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

### Development Tips

- The app requires macOS and Apple Music for full functionality
- Tests use a simulated player environment for cross-platform compatibility
- Visual regression tests run automatically in CI/CD via Lost Pixel with robust background image loading detection
- Visual tests include API mocking to handle external service failures gracefully
- Use `[data-testid="..."]` attributes for test selectors
- GitHub Actions include advanced caching for faster CI/CD builds:
  - pnpm store caching for dependencies
  - Playwright browser caching for E2E tests
  - Turborepo task caching for optimized builds

## 🚀 CI/CD Workflows

The project includes three GitHub Actions workflows:

### Main CI (`ci.yml`)
Runs on pushes to main branch:
- **Tests Job**: Unit and integration tests with Turborepo caching
- **E2E Job**: Functional Playwright tests with browser caching
- **Artifacts**: Playwright reports uploaded for 30 days

### Pull Request CI (`pr.yml`)
Runs on pull requests for quick feedback

### Visual Regression Testing (`vrt.yml`)
Runs on pull requests:
- **Lost Pixel Integration**: Automated visual regression detection
- **Screenshot Comparison**: Compares UI changes against baselines
- **Background Loading**: Robust handling of artwork loading and network failures
- **API Mocking**: Consistent test results with mocked external services
- **Artifacts**: Visual test results and Playwright reports
- **Cloud Integration**: Results available in Lost Pixel dashboard

### Caching Strategy
All workflows implement multi-level caching:
- **Dependencies**: pnpm store cached by lockfile hash
- **Browsers**: Playwright browsers cached by package.json hash
- **Build Outputs**: Turborepo handles task-level caching
